# What is OpenVoiceOS? A Beginner's Guide to Privacy-First Voice AI

In a world where most voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant are tied to big tech companies, OpenVoiceOS (OVOS) offers a different path. It's a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) platform for voice AI.

Think of it this way: 🗣️ OpenVoiceOS is an operating system and a framework, a complete toolkit for building voice-controlled devices. Unlike proprietary systems that send your voice commands to the cloud for processing, OVOS is designed to keep your data private and on your device. This means you have full control over your information, ensuring it's not being used for targeted ads or other commercial purposes without your consent.

The core idea is transparency and user control. You can see the code, modify it, and run it on your own hardware, from a Raspberry Pi to a desktop computer. This makes OVOS an ideal choice for developers, hobbyists, and businesses who want to build secure and privacy-respecting voice solutions.

TigreGóticoLda is proud to be a key part of this mission. We are the lead developers of OpenVoiceOS. Note that while we provide professional services, OpenVoiceOS itself is a non-profit foundation based in the Netherlands, ensuring its core technology remains free and open for everyone.

## What is HiveMind? Extending Your Voice Network

If OpenVoiceOS is the brain of your voice-controlled device, then HiveMind is the nervous system that connects everything.

HiveMind is a flexible communication protocol that allows a central OVOS instance (the "hub") to communicate with multiple other devices (the "satellites"). 📡 It's designed to be lightweight and scalable. This means you can have one powerful machine running OpenVoiceOS, and then connect many other, less powerful devices to it for voice control.

For example, you could have a smart speaker with OVOS in your living room, and a small, inexpensive voice satellite in every other room. When you speak to a satellite, your command is securely sent to the main OVOS hub for processing, and the response is sent back to the satellite. This allows you to have a connected, multi-room voice network without needing a powerful, data-hungry device in every single location.

Together, OpenVoiceOS and HiveMind form a powerful, private, and customizable ecosystem for voice technology. As the lead developers of both projects, we have a unique and unparalleled understanding of the technology, which we bring to all our consulting and development services at TigreGóticoLda.
